After our preprocessing job is complete, our next job is to do clustering of data.

Why we divide data into different clusters and train separate model for each is explained well in the register notes for this project that
R1+R2 > R where R means residual score for complete data and R1 and R2 are for each cluster.

we are going to use Kmeans in this project to cluster the data and to select optimal K i.e. no. of clusters, we ue elbow method and kneeLocator.

Focus comes back to the trainModel.py file from the 2nd half of the trainModel() method.
All clustering functions used here, their ctrl+click takes us to the clustering.py file in the data_preprocesing folder in root dir.

All functions for clustering explained there and ctrl+click for details.

We have also saved the clustered data and model bcoz:

            """We are saving the clustered data and model bcoz later on when new data records from client comes to us,
               model will help us classify that new records/rows into clusters we made just now so that we can apply
               specific model to these clusters."""
