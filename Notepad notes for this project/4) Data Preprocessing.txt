Now we have all the clubbed data from database saved into the InputFile.csv file inside the Training_FileFromDB folder inside the root directory.

Our next goal is to perform data preprocessing on this whole clubbed csv data.

The way we had begun the explanation of this project from the main.py file in which we began explanation of trainRouteClient() function
which had objects initialized of train_validation class and calling the train_validation() function of train_validation class completes
the whole validation and the whole train_validation class was explained in the training_Validation_Insertion.py file and we can go through
the explanation by ctrl+click.

Similarly in this same function trainRouteClient() in the main.py, we have object initialization of trainModel() class whose method
trainingModel() is called. Ctrl+click takes us to the trainingModel.py file in the data_preprocessinf folder in the root dir which has class trainModel() which has all the preprocessing
or the feature engineering steps after which model training also done in this same class.

Before the feature engineering explanation detail, we will go through the EDA graphs, bcoz all preprocessing steps are decided as per the
EDA.

EDA done in jupter file EDA_fraudDetection.ipynb in the EDA folder of the root directory of this project.
Open this jupyter file and each and every explanation is given very well there.

explanation of whole preprocessing and EDA given in this jupyter and as of now just go through jupyter code only till end of EDA part
and stop when the title model selection and tuning beguns.

All the above jupyter code will be now implementes in the trainModel class in the trainingModel.py

Now the focus comes to the trainingModel.py file which has class trainModel which has only 1 function trainingModel() which first reads 
the csv file and does preprocessing. Go through each and every function there along with it's comments and ctrl+click.
For the logging of this file, we have selected file ModelTrainingLog.txt from the Training_logs folder of the root directory of this project.
