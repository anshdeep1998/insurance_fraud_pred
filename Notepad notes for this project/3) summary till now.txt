Summary for prev:

1) in training_Validation_Insertion.py file, we had this class train_validation in which we initialized objects of 2 classes and the 1st
object of 1st class was self.raw_data = Raw_Data_validation(path) i.e. object of Raw_Data_validation class of the rawValidation.py file which has following functions to validate the training data sent in batches by the client.

-> valuesFromSchema to return no. of columns, names of columns, their lengths etc. from schema
-> manualRegexCreation to check names of training data batch files are according to correct name format as per regex.
-> validationFileNameRaw check names of training data batch files again but this time for length of date and time in the name of each file.
-> validateColumnLength to validate lengths of each column.
-> validateMissingValuesInWholeColumn to check if any column is there having all values as null
-> replaceMissingWithNull to replace missing empty values with string "Null" and replace '' with "".
->deleteExistingGoodDataTrainingFolder to delete existing good data folder bcoz after shifting good validated data to database,
                                            we delete that folder
-> similarly we have deleteExistingBadDataTrainingFolder function in rawValidation.py file to delete existing bad data folder bcoz we 
   transfer bad data which failed validation conditions into an archive folder and delete existing bad data folder.

->moveBadFilesToArchiveBad() to send bad data which failed validation conditions into an archive folder.

2) in DataTypeValidation.py file, we have class named dBOperations which has following functions mainly to deal with the database:

->createTableDb to create a table in sqllite database to club and store all csv batch files data.
->insertIntoTableGoodData to insert all good data which passed the validation conditions into database.
->selectingDatafromtableintocsv to save all the data which was clubbed into the database as csv.
